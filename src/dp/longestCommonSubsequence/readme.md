# Longest Common SubSequence - LCS
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous

Input a = "abcsed";
	 b = "absgdf";

Output: 4 ("absd")

Q 1. find length of LCS?
Q 2. find value of LCS? 

## LCS Based Problem
###1. Longest Common Substring
Given two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’, find the length of the longest common substring.
Examples:

Input : X = “GeeksforGeeks”, y = “GeeksQuiz”
Output : 5
The longest common substring is “Geeks” and is of length 5.

###2. Shortest Common SuperSequence
Given two strings str1 and str2, find the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences.
Examples:

Input:   str1 = "geek",  str2 = "eke"
Output: "geeke" 

###3. Min number of insertion and deletion to make a->b
Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

Example:
Input : str1 = "geeksforgeeks", str2 = "geeks"
Output : Minimum Deletion = 8
         Minimum Insertion = 0 

###4. Longest Palindromic subSequence

Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.
Example :
Input:"bbbab"
Output:4 (bbbb)

###5. Longest Palindromic SubString

Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subString in it.
Example :
Input:"bbbab"
Output:3 (bab)

###6. Minimum number of deletion in string to make it a palindrom

Given a string of size ‘n’. The task is to remove or delete minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is palindrome.
Examples :

Input : aebcbda
Output : 2
Remove characters 'e' and 'd'
Resultant string will be 'abcba'
which is a palindromic string

###7. Minimum number of insertion in string to make it a palindrom

Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to form Palindrome string out of given string

Examples:
ab: Number of insertions required is 1. bab
aa: Number of insertions required is 0. aa

###8. SubSequence Pattern Matching

a: "abc"
b: "dvsafbmnc"
o/p - true
